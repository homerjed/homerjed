## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like using generative models to extract information in Bayesian inference problems on fundamental physics in cosmology.

I'm interested in generative models...
* [Score-based diffusion models](https://github.com/homerjed/sgm)
* [Variational Diffusion models (VDMs)](https://github.com/homerjed/vdm)
* [Variational Diffusion Autoencoder (VDAE)](https://github.com/homerjed/vdae)

...transformer models & geometric deep learning in general
* [Set Transformer](https://github.com/homerjed/set_transformer)
* [Compact Convolutional Transformers](https://github.com/schmrlng/cct)
* [Vision transformers](https://github.com/homerjed/simple_vision_transformer)

...and statistical problems in general
* [Frequentist-matching priors](https://github.com/homerjed/frequentist_matching_priors)
* [Hierarchical Bayesian Neural Networks (HBNNs)](https://github.com/homerjed/hbnn)
